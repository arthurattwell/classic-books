# Ode on Solitude

  Happy the man whose wish and care  
    A few paternal acres bound,  
  Content to breathe his native air,  
      In his own ground.  

  Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,                  *5*{:.line-number}  
    Whose flocks supply him with attire,  
  Whose trees in summer yield him shade,  
      In winter fire.  

  Blest, who can unconcern'dly find  
    Hours, days, and years slide soft away,                       *10*{:.line-number}  
  In health of body, peace of mind,  
      Quiet by day,  

  Sound sleep by night; study and ease,  
    Together mixt; sweet recreation;  
  And Innocence, which most does please                           *15*{:.line-number}  
      With meditation.  

  Thus let me live, unseen, unknown,  
    Thus unlamented let me die,  
  Steal from the world, and not a stone  
      Tell where I lie.                                           *20*{:.line-number}
