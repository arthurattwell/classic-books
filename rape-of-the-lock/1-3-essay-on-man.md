# An Essay on Man

To  H. St. John Lord Bolingbroke

## The Design


Having proposed to write some pieces on Human Life and Manners, such as
(to use my Lord Bacon's expression) _come home to Men's Business and
Bosoms_, I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering _Man_
in the abstract, his _Nature_ and his _State_; since, to prove any moral
duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or
imperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know
what _condition_ and _relation_ it is placed in, and what is the proper
end and purpose of its _being_.

The science of Human Nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a
_few clear points_: There are not _many certain truths_ in this world.
It is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as in that of the Body; more
good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and
perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and
vessels, the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our
observation. The _disputes_ are all upon these last, and, I will venture
to say, they have less sharpened the _wits_ than the _hearts_ of men
against each other, and have diminished the practice, more than advanced
the theory of Morality. If I could flatter myself that this Essay has
any merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly
opposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming a
_temperate_ yet not _inconsistent_, and a _short_ yet not _imperfect_
system of Ethics.

This I might have done in prose, but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for
two reasons. The one will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or
precepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first, and
are more easily retained by him afterwards: The other may seem odd, but
is true, I found I could express them more _shortly_ this way than in
prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the _force_
as well as _grace_ of arguments or instructions, depends on their
_conciseness_. I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in
_detail_, without becoming dry and tedious; or more _poetically_,
without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandring from the
precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: If any man can unite all
these without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will
compass a thing above my capacity.

What is now published, is only to be considered as a _general Map_ of
MAN, marking out no more than the _greater parts_, their _extent_, their
_limits_, and their _connection_, and leaving the particular to be more
fully delineated in the charts which are to follow. Consequently, these
Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any
progress) will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament. I
am here only opening the _fountains_, and clearing the passage. To
deduce the _rivers_, to follow them in their course, and to observe
their effects, may be a task more agreeable.

## Epistle I: Argument

Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to the UNIVERSE.


_Of_ Man _in the abstract_.


I.   v. 17 &c.    _That we can judge only with regard to our_ own
                  system, _being ignorant of the_ relations _of
                  systems and things_.

II.  v. 35, &c.   _That Man is not to be deemed_ imperfect, _but a Being
                  suited to his_ place _and_ rank _in the creation,
                  agreeable to the_ general Order _of things, and
                  conformable to_ Ends _and_ Relations _to him unknown_.

III. v. 77, &c.   _That it is partly upon his_ ignorance _of_ future
                  _events, and partly upon the_ hope _of a_ future
                  _state, that all his happiness in the present
                  depends_.

IV.  v. 109, &c. _The_ pride _of aiming at more knowledge, and
                 pretending to more Perfections, the cause of Man's
                 error and misery. The_ impiety _of putting himself in
                 the place of_ God, _and judging of the fitness or
                 unfitness, perfection or imperfection, justice or
                 injustice of his dispensations_.

V.   v. 131, &c. _The_ absurdity _of conceiting himself the _final cause
                 _of the creation, or expecting that perfection in the_
                 moral _world, which is not in the_ natural.

VI.  v. 173, &c. _The_ unreasonableness _of his complaints against_
                 Providence, _while on the one hand he demands the
                 Perfections of the Angels, and on the other the bodily
                 qualifications of the Brutes; though, to possess any of
                 the_ sensitive faculties _in a higher degree, would
                 render him miserable_.

VII. v. 207.     _That throughout the whole visible world, an universal_
                 order _and_ gradation _in the sensual and mental
                 faculties is observed, which causes a_ subordination
                 _of creature to creature, and of all creatures to Man.
                 The gradations of_ sense, instinct, thought,
                 reflection, reason; _that Reason alone countervails
                 fill the other faculties_.

VIII. v. 233.    _How much further this_ order _and_ subordination _of
                 living creatures may extend, above and below us; were
                 any part of which broken, not that part only, but the
                 whole connected_ creation _must be destroyed_.

IX.  v. 250.     _The_ extravagance, madness, _and_ pride _of such a
                 desire_.

X.   v. 281, &c. _to the end_. _The consequence of all, the_ absolute submission _due to Providence, both as to our_ present _and_ future state,





## Epistle I


Awake, my ST. JOHN! leave all meaner things  
To low ambition, and the pride of Kings.  
Let us (since Life can little more supply  
Than just to look about us and to die)  
Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;                  *5*{:.line-number}  
A mighty maze! but not without a plan;  
A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;  
Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.  
Together let us beat this ample field,  
Try what the open, what the covert yield;                  *10*{:.line-number}  
The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore  
Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;  
Eye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,  
And catch the Manners living as they rise;  
Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;               *15*{:.line-number}  
But vindicate the ways of God to Man.  
  
I.      Say first, of God above, or Man below,  
What can we reason, but from what we know?  
Of Man, what see we but his station here,  
From which to reason, or to which refer?                   *20*{:.line-number}  
Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,  
'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.  
He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce,  
See worlds on worlds compose one universe,  
Observe how system into system runs,                       *25*{:.line-number}  
What other planets circle other suns,  
What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry star,  
May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are.  
But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,  
The strong connexions, nice dependencies,                  *30*{:.line-number}  
Gradations just, has thy pervading soul  
Look'd thro'? or can a part contain the whole?  
  
Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,  
And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?  
  
II.     Presumptuous Man! the reason wouldst thou find,            *35*{:.line-number}  
Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?  
First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,  
Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less?  
Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made  
Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?              *40*{:.line-number}  
Or ask of yonder argent fields above,  
Why JOVE'S satellites are less than JOVE?  
  
Of Systems possible, if 'tis confest  
That Wisdom infinite must form the best,  
Where all must full or not coherent be,                    *45*{:.line-number}  
And all that rises, rise in due degree;  
Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain,  
There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:  
And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)  
Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong?                 *50*{:.line-number}  
  
Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,  
May, must be right, as relative to all.  
In human works, tho' labour'd on with pain,  
A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;  
In God's, one single can its end produce;                  *55*{:.line-number}  
Yet serves to second too some other use.  
So Man, who here seems principal alone,  
Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,  
Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;  
'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.                   *60*{:.line-number}  
  
When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains  
His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains:  
When the dull Ox, why now he breaks the clod,  
Is now a victim, and now Ægypt's God:  
Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend              *65*{:.line-number}  
His actions', passions', being's, use and end;  
Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why  
This hour a slave, the next a deity.  
  
Then say not Man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault;  
Say rather, Man's as perfect as he ought:                  *70*{:.line-number}  
His knowledge measur'd to his state and place;  
His time a moment, and a point his space.  
If to be perfect in a certain sphere,  
What matter, soon or late, or here or there?  
The blest to day is as completely so,                      *75*{:.line-number}  
As who began a thousand years ago.  
  
III.    Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate,  
All but the page prescrib'd, their present state:  
From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:  
Or who could suffer Being here below?                      *80*{:.line-number}  
The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,  
Had he thy Reason, would he skip and play?  
Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food,  
And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.  
Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,                  *85*{:.line-number}  
That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n:  
Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,  
A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,  
Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,  
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.                   *90*{:.line-number}  
  
Hope humbly then: with trembling pinions soar;  
Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.  
What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,  
But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now.  
Hope springs eternal in the human breast:                  *95*{:.line-number}  
Man never Is, but always To be blest:  
The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,  
Rests and expatiates in a life to come.  
  
Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind  
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind:             *100*{:.line-number}  
His soul, proud Science never taught to stray  
Far as the solar walk, or milky way;  
Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,  
Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n;  
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,              *105*{:.line-number}  
Some happier island in the watry waste,  
Where slaves once more their native land behold,  
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.  
To Be, contents his natural desire,  
He asks no Angel's wing, no Seraph's fire;                *110*{:.line-number}  
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,  
His faithful dog shall bear him company.  
  
IV.     Go, wiser thou! and, in thy scale of sense,  
Weight thy Opinion against Providence;  
Call imperfection what thou fancy'st such,                *115*{:.line-number}  
Say, here he gives too little, there too much:  
Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust,  
Yet cry, If Man's unhappy, God's unjust;  
If Man alone engross not Heav'n's high care,  
Alone made perfect here, immortal there:                  *120*{:.line-number}  
Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,  
Re-judge his justice, be the God of God.  
In Pride, in reas'ning Pride, our error lies;  
All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.  
  
Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,                *125*{:.line-number}  
Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods.  
Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell,  
Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel:  
And who but wishes to invert the laws  
Of ORDER, sins against th' Eternal Cause.                 *130*{:.line-number}  
  
V.      Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine,  
Earth for whose use? Pride answers, "'Tis for mine:  
For me kind Nature wakes her genial Pow'r,  
Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r;  
Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew                  *135*{:.line-number}  
The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;  
For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;  
For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;  
Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;  
My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies."                *140*{:.line-number}  
  
But errs not Nature from his gracious end,  
From burning suns when livid deaths descend,  
When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep  
Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?  
"No, ('tis reply'd) the first Almighty Cause              *145*{:.line-number}  
Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws;  
Th' exceptions few; some change since all began:  
And what created perfect?"--Why then Man?  
If the great end be human Happiness,  
Then Nature deviates; and can Man do less?                *150*{:.line-number}  
As much that end a constant course requires  
Of show'rs and sun-shine, as of Man's desires;  
As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,  
As Men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise.  
If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design,      *155*{:.line-number}  
Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?  
Who knows but he, whose hand the lightning forms,  
Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms;  
Pours fierce Ambition in a Cæsar's mind,  
Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?            *160*{:.line-number}  
From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs;  
Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:  
Why charge we Heav'n in those, in these acquit?  
In both, to reason right is to submit.  
  
Better for Us, perhaps, it might appear,                  *165*{:.line-number}  
Were there all harmony, all virtue here;  
That never air or ocean felt the wind;  
That never passion discompos'd the mind.  
But ALL subsists by elemental strife;  
And Passions are the elements of Life.                    *170*{:.line-number}  
The gen'ral ORDER, since the whole began,  
Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man.  
  
VI.     What would this Man? Now upward will he soar,  
And little less than Angel, would be more;  
Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears            *175*{:.line-number}  
To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.  
Made for his use all creatures if he call,  
Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all?  
Nature to these, without profusion, kind,  
The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd;                *180*{:.line-number}  
Each seeming want compensated of course,  
Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;  
All in exact proportion to the state;  
Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.  
Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:                *185*{:.line-number}  
Is Heav'n unkind to Man, and Man alone?  
Shall he alone, whom rational we call,  
Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all?  
  
The bliss of Man (could Pride that blessing find)  
Is not to act or think beyond mankind;                    *190*{:.line-number}  
No pow'rs of body or of soul to share,  
But what his nature and his state can bear.  
Why has not Man a microscopic eye?  
For this plain reason, Man is not a Fly.  
Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n,                *195*{:.line-number}  
T' inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n?  
Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,  
To smart and agonize at every pore?  
Or quick effluvia darting thro' the brain,  
Die of a rose in aromatic pain?                           *200*{:.line-number}  
If Nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears,  
And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,  
How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still  
The whisp'ring Zephyr, and the purling rill?  
Who finds not Providence all good and wise,               *205*{:.line-number}  
Alike in what it gives, and what denies?  
  
VII.    Far as Creation's ample range extends,  
The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends:  
Mark how it mounts, to Man's imperial race,  
From the green myriads in the peopled grass:            *210*{:.line-number}  
What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,  
The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:  
Of smell, the headlong lioness between,  
And hound sagacious on the tainted green:  
Of hearing, from the life that fills the Flood,        *215*{:.line-number}  
To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood:  
The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!  
Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:  
In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true  
From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew?         *220*{:.line-number}  
How Instinct varies in the grov'lling swine,  
Compar'd, half-reas'ning elephant, with thine!  
'Twixt that, and Reason, what a nice barrier,  
For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near!  
Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd;                 *225*{:.line-number}  
What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide:  
And Middle natures, how they long to join,  
Yet never pass th' insuperable line!  
Without this just gradation, could they be  
Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?             *230*{:.line-number}  
The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone,  
Is not thy Reason all these pow'rs in one?  
  
VIII.   See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth,  
All matter quick, and bursting into birth.  
Above, how high, progressive life may go!              *235*{:.line-number}  
Around, how wide! how deep extend below!  
Vast chain of Being! which from God began,  
Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,  
Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,  
No glass can reach; from Infinite to thee,             *240*{:.line-number}  
From thee to Nothing.--On superior pow'rs  
Were we to press, inferior might on ours:  
Or in the full creation leave a void,  
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:  
From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,          *245*{:.line-number}  
Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.  
  
And, if each system in gradation roll  
Alike essential to th' amazing Whole,  
The least confusion but in one, not all  
That system only, but the Whole must fall.             *250*{:.line-number}  
Let Earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,  
Planets and Suns run lawless thro' the sky;  
Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurl'd,  
Being on Being wreck'd, and world on world;  
Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod,        *255*{:.line-number}  
And Nature tremble to the throne of God.  
All this dread ORDER break--for whom? for thee?  
Vile worm!--Oh Madness! Pride! Impiety!  
  
IX.     What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread,  
Or hand, to toil, aspir'd to be the head?              *260*{:.line-number}  
What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd  
To serve mere engines to the ruling Mind?  
Just as absurd for any part to claim  
To be another, in this gen'ral frame:  
Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,           *265*{:.line-number}  
The great directing MIND of ALL ordains.  
  
All are but parts of one stupendous whole,  
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;  
That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same;  
Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame;          *270*{:.line-number}  
Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,  
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,  
Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent,  
Spreads undivided, operates unspent;  
Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,         *275*{:.line-number}  
As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart:  
As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns,  
As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns:  
To him no high, no low, no great, no small;  
He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.         *280*{:.line-number}  
  
X.      Cease then, nor ORDER Imperfection name:  
Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.  
Know thy own point: This kind, this due degree  
Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee.  
Submit.--In this, or any other sphere,                 *285*{:.line-number}  
Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:  
Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r,  
Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.  
All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee;  
All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see;       *290*{:.line-number}  
All Discord, Harmony not understood;  
All partial Evil, universal Good:  
And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite,  
One truth is clear, WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT.
