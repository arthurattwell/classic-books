# The Descent of Dullness

From the 'Dunciad', Book IV

In vain, in vain--the all-composing Hour  
Resistless falls: the Muse obeys the Pow'r.  
She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold  
Of _Night_ prim√¶val and of _Chaos_ old!  
Before her, _Fancy's_ gilded clouds decay,                      *5*{:.line-number}  
And all its varying Rain-bows die away.  
_Wit_ shoots in vain its momentary fires,  
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.  
As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,  
The sick'ning stars fade off th' ethereal plain;               *10*{:.line-number}  
As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand opprest,  
Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest;  
Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,  
_Art_ after _Art_ goes out, and all is Night.  
See skulking _Truth_ to her old cavern fled,                   *15*{:.line-number}  
Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!  
_Philosophy_, that lean'd on Heav'n before,  
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.  
_Physic_ of _Metaphysic_ begs defence,  
And _Metaphysic_ calls for aid on _Sense_!                     *20*{:.line-number}  
See _Mystery_ to _Mathematics_ fly!  
In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.  
_Religion_ blushing veils her sacred fires,  
And unawares _Morality_ expires.  
For _public_ Flame, nor _private_, dares to shine;             *25*{:.line-number}  
Nor _human_ Spark is left, nor Glimpse _divine_!  
Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd;  
Light dies before thy uncreating word;  
Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall,  
And universal Darkness buries All.                             *30*{:.line-number}
